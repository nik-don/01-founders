Finally managed to tame lem-in.


This has been I believe one of the toughest programming challenges I have faced.

I wanted to do everything from scratch. As I have done in the past since the selection pool. Maybe this is why it took so long. Perhaps this is why my morale kept getting low each time I hit the wall. 
Maybe because, as always, I did NOT google the keyword and see what came up.
Yes. I will be smug about it. 

For full transparency, though, I did wonder what is out there and did a Google search after I felt like I was not going anywhere. But I ONLY did this after having re-written my code for the 3rd time. 

I can't stress enough how you need to talk to other people about the project. Explain to them in your words what you think are the requirements.
It took me a very long time just to understand them. It is a puzzle in itself, where you have to decipher the text, by rearranging it getting some context and going somewhere with it.

Luckily, Esteban had been through this route and I phoned him and confirmed my findings with him.

The many breakthroughs came by just looking at the patterns. There were many times when I would just scribble the paths and draw graphs, to just stare at them. And from out of nowhere, I would spot a pattern. 
Every time I had something, I would set out to convert that idea to code and test it out.
And after many iterations. I finally managed to find the paths that an ant should be taking.

And I thought I was done. 
Because all I had to do was print them outright? Oh, boy was I wrong.

So if you are currently attempting this project, you will notice there are quite a few of these moments. Every time you get a feeling you're close to finishing the project, the final solution is further away than you think.

The next breakthrough came when I was explaining to Esteban how I got the correct output for one example, but I got something different from another.  And I realized that we also need to optimize the paths that the ants take.

At this point, there are too many variables to keep track of, and seeing how they changed inside a function or in a loop was a big chore in itself. 
Discovering how to use the VS Code debugger helped a lot. I do admit, it is tricky to understand how to get some meaningful information if you haven't used it before.

The final breakthrough came when Jon and I were attempting to figure out how to find the paths that the ants should be taking. I kind of harshly told him. “Come on Jon, let us work this out on paper” and the next we know is that we somehow managed to do some basic maths and come up with a solution.
It was still a theory at that point and fast-forward to now, I am happy to say that it worked.

Thanks again to those who took their time and conferred over this particular project.
